Rice Image Classifier ðŸŒ¾
- This project is an image classification system that identifies different types of rice grains using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A simple user interface (UI) is built using Streamlit so users can upload rice images and see predictions.

Objective
- Build a deep learning model to classify different rice grain types using a pre-trained CNN and provide predictions via a user-friendly web app.

 Dataset
- Rice Image Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset
- Contains images of different rice types in separate folders
- Each folder name is the rice type label

Environment Setup
- pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn pillow

How to Run the App
- streamlit run app.py

   Upload Image
- Use the upload button in the web app
- It will show:
- The uploaded image
- Predicted rice grain type

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
