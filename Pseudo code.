IMPORT necessary libraries:
    - TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, NumPy, PIL (Image)

LOAD trained CNN model using keras.models.load_model()

SET Streamlit title and header

IF user uploads an image:
    - Open image using PIL
    - Resize image to (28, 28)
    - Convert to numpy array
    - Normalize values to [0, 1]
    - Reshape to (1, 28, 28, 3) for batch prediction

    - Predict using the model
    - Use argmax to get the predicted class index
    - Map index to actual rice category name

    - Display:
        - Uploaded image
        - Predicted label and probability for each class

ELSE:
    - Prompt user to upload an image
